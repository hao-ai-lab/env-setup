General repository to setup environments 

## Need Help
- [ ] Add a gitbook + CI/CD to deploy the gitbook. Help us searching the repo
- [ ] Add a doc to make the repo organized. 

## Commit Guide
1. Add a folder. Folder name should generally be `<env>-<description>`, say `runpod-sglang-amd`
2. Add a README in the folder. This is the high-level instruction + code to reproduce your environment.
